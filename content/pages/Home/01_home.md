### The Lives We Impact

> As DHANITE: When  Dhan wanted to start the projects in and around Tiruchuli, it was Ramana Vidya Peedam
 which showered hospitality by providing space to young aspirants for shaping the lives of poor without 
 any cost which will ever be remembered by me. I have taken many of my friends from DHAN and Kendra. 
 Love was showered in total and those who visited the ashram became well wishers which includes my mother too.

> During the year 1992, heard about fasting camps in the Ashram and entered Ramana Vidya Peedam Ashram.
They made me fast for 10 days where 4 days were water fasting, 3 days juice fasting, 3 days diet food fasting.
After undergoing this fasting, my nose block, sore throat, my back pain and my knee pain vanished.
After this incident, if I dont feel well, i go to Ramana Vidya Peedam, do fasting.
Never been to a hospital after learning the fasting techniques.
